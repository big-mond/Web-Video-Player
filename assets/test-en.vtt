These are Test Captions.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.000
Im sure no one is actually saying the words on these.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.800
I've been having a lot of fun learning to code.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.300
I never knew when I was younger, but I've always been

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.400
headed in this direction, and it feels great.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.500
Im going to make something one day that will change the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.900
world and I'm eager to figure out just what that'll be.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.700
Hopefully I can inspire people from backgrounds similar

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.800
to mine, to find a passion for not only coding, but 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.00
creating in general.
